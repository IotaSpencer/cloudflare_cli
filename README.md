= cloudflare_cli

A Command Line Interface for interacting with CloudFlare's API without having to
mess with scripting a script yourself.


== Installation

    gem install cloudflare_cli

== About

This is not a library or require'able gem, this is an executable only.
If you wish to use CloudFlare's API in more advanced ways, then you would need
to install a gem that is requirable like [RubyFlare](https://github.com/trev/rubyflare)
which this gem uses behind the scenes.

    gem install rubyflare
